This dataset includes 615 patients from the South Indian population, who were evaluated for diabetic retinopathy (DR) grade at baseline and again after four years of follow-up to study the progression of the disease. Along with DR grading, information on 20 clinical risk factors was collected: age, gender, diabetes status (known diabetics, newly detected, or non-diabetics), duration of diabetes in years, presence of hypertension, duration of hypertension in months, ischemic heart disease, asthma, insulin use, any other significant diabetes-related history, smoking status, alcohol status, family history of diabetes, resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference, and hip circumference. This longitudinal dataset provides an opportunity to analyze baseline characteristics, monitor progression of DR over time, and explore associations between clinical risk factors and disease outcomes.
